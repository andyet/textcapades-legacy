#textcapades-legacy

This is the original code that ran the textcapade for [&yetConf](http://andyetconf.com).

Textcapade was generously sponsored by [Tropo](https://www.tropo.com).

The textcapade story was written by [Mike Speegle](https://twitter.com/mike_speegle), and directed by [Adam Brault](https://twitter.com/adambrault).

The textcapade code was written by [Heather Seaman](https://github.com/one000mph) during her 2015 Summer internship at [&yet](https://andyet.com).

The textcapade website was designed by [Lynn Fisher](https://github.com/lynnandtonic) and [Terry Carter](https://github.com/meetthelegend).

After Heather's Summer ended, and a quick refactoring by [Gar](https://github.com/wraithgar), the codebase was taken over by [Terry Carter](https://github.com/meetthelegend) who took it from prototype with one episode to the finished product that ran up to and through the conference.

Textcapade was operated by [Bear](http://github.com/bear) and [NLF](https://github.com/nlf).

We are releasing this code now because many people wanted to peek under the hood at how we delivered the experience to everyone.  It is not being actively maintained and is considered a legacy codebase.

There is also a project under way to convert the story into one you can play over the web (versus SMS as it was originally intended).  You can find it [here](https://github.com/andyet/textcapades).
